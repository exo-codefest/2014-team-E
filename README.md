# What's MasterTask?
 
With the aim of making easy for managing your jobs more effectively, our team would like to introduce MasterTask - a friendly and easy-to-use task manager.
Even you are good at technique or not, this app is totally in your hand! 
Use this app to control projects and their relevant tasks, then share with your group - so simple with MasterTask!

Because of time (2 days for app development) and limitation to members that are required by eXo Jury, 
our team decided to finish some main points of our app, and next will be promising featutes and of course a cool delicated User Interface from BD team. 
See the table to know which you can play now, and next features of **MasterTask** that will be introduced soon.
