# What's MasterTask?
 
With the aim of making easy for managing your jobs, our team would like to introduce **MasterTask** - a friendly and powerful task management tool.
Even you are good at technique or not, this app is totally in your hands! 
Use this app to control projects and their relevant tasks, then share with your group - so simple but effective with **MasterTask**!

# Overview of MasterTask

Because of limitations to time (2 days for app development) and members (maximum 4 members) as suggested by eXo Jury, 
our team decided to finish some main points of our app, and next will be promising features and of course a cool User Interface from BD Team. 
See the table to know which you can play now, as well more features that will be introduced soon.
